# Deep Solar Segmentation Using U-Net Architecture

## Overview

This project implements a deep learning model for semantic segmentation of solar panels in satellite images using the U-Net architecture. Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that involves assigning a class label to each pixel in an image. In this project, we focus on segmenting solar panels from satellite images, which can be useful for various applications such as urban planning, energy monitoring, and environmental studies.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aravind1000/Deep_Solar_Segmentation_Using_U-Net_Architecture.git
    ```
2. Install the require dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the train.py script to train the U-Net model:

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

4. To run it:
   
   ```bash
    python run.py
    ```
